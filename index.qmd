Welcome!

I am a PhD Candidate at the Department of Economics at Ghent University, funded by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO).

Before starting my PhD, I graduated in Economics with honors from Tor Vergata University of Rome. I also worked as an intern at the Ifo Institute in Munich,
as a research assistant at the University of Tübingen and ENS Lyon, and as a research analyst at the European Central Bank.

My research focuses on methodologies to elicit beliefs under uncertainty. 

I use experimental and survey methods, together with econometric techniques, to study how subjective expectations shape economic behavior across different domains. My research interests include environmental economics, labor economics, and inflation expectations.
