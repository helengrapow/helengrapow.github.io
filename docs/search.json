I also worked as an intern at the Ifo Institute in Munich, as a research assistant on a joint project with the University of Tübingen and ENS Lyon, and as a research analyst at the European Central Bank.\nMy research focuses on methodologies to elicit beliefs under uncertainty.\nI use experimental and survey methods, together with econometric techniques, to study how subjective expectations shape economic behavior across different domains. My research interests include environmental economics, labor economics, and inflation expectations."
